# quickPassGenerator

A graphical interface for my previous project [quickPassGenerator](https://github.com/ark948/quickPassGenerator.git)

You can use both 'app.py' and 'app.pyw' to run the program (app.pyw won't open a console windows alongside the app's main window)

Note: Code is a bit messy right now, sorry.
